**Date:** May-June 2025

This project implements a remote *weather station*. The premise is to use multiple Arduino devices to create a network of data nodes. These nodes will monitor temperature, pressure and estimated wave shore impact/height at sea level. Collected data will then be displayed in a web application, to be used by fishermen, researchers or hobbyists.

## Features

- Temperature and pressure measurement
- Wave characteristics estimation
- Real-time data visualization
- Web application dashboard

## Architecture

The project consists of three main components:
- **Arduino**: Data collection sensors and transmission modules
- **Backend**: Data processing, storage and API services
- **Frontend**: Web interface for data visualization and analysis

## Tools & Technologies

**Arduino**
- Arduino (hardware sensors and microcontrollers)
- RFM22 cards (wireless communication)

**Backend:**
- Python
- Flask

**Frontend visualization:**
- Vite
- TypeScript
- React
- Tailwind CSS
